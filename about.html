                         <h3>What is Generative Art?</h3>
                         &nbsp;
                         <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Generative art refers to art that has either been somewhat or completely made by an autonomous system—most often being a computer.</p>
                         &nbsp;
                         <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This form of art introduces the concept of <i>controlled randomness</i>, which is an element of chance within a set of predetermined
                              boundaries. This results in unique pieces that are virtually impossible to recreate exactly, as each program run will produce a different interpretation of the artwork.</p>
                         &nbsp;
                    </div>

                    <div class="clearfix"></div>

                    &nbsp;

                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">On the contrary, creative coding more broadly describes the type of computer programming with the goal to create something expressive rather than 
                         functional. Generative art falls under this category as one of the more popular forms of creative coding, although there are various other types as well.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Creative coding is innovative for its ability to integrate computer science and art into a single practice. During our modern society, technology 
                         is becoming more and more prevalent in the daily function of many; it is only appropriate that art, being a craft that largely reflects the broader 
                         period of a society, should be able to keep up with the immense change we are faced with. </p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This is where the beauty of generative art comes in. It’s an artistic twist on the practice that is attributed with the vast majority of the 
                         development in the 21st century. Furthermore, it encourages the creative expression of those who are not interested in the traditional ways of creating art, such as 
                         painting or sculpting. Those who tend to favour STEM-related disciplines would be able to engage in creative and technical pursuits all the same, allowing for more 
                         variety and well-rounded interests in these individuals.</p>
                    &nbsp;
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">That is why this website exists, as a way of introducing the practice of creative coding and generative art to any that might be interested. Here, 
                         you can find several examples of what a computer is capable of creating, and how code can be turned into a fascinating artistic piece. Through this exploration, it is encouraged 
                         that one might reframe their traditional conception on what art must look like and how it can be produced. Once this reframing occurs on a broader scale, modern art can be 
                         advanced and revolutionized.</p>
